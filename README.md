# Hi there, I'm Michael

**Data Scientist | Consciousness Researcher | Reality Architect**

Based in Regensburg, Germany

I explore the convergence of **Artificial Intelligence**, **Formal Logic**, and **Metaphysics**. My work focuses on architecting sovereign, autonomous systems that bridge the gap between data science and the ontological primitives of reality.

### My Magnum Opus: The Exocortex
I am engineering a **Sovereign Cognitive Architecture** for the home environment - a personal "Exocortex".
My objective is to instantiate enterprise-grade data foundries and cognitive engines within a local, open-source ecosystem, ensuring absolute **Data Sovereignty** and **Cognitive Security** through epistemological grounding.

* **Infrastructure:** Localized inference on "Exo" (Ryzen AI 9 / Radeon 890M).
* **Paradigm:** Transitioning from stochastic pattern matching to **Causal AI** and **Symbolic Compression**.

### Tech Stack
* **Core:** Python, TypeScript, Data Science, AI Inference
* **The Logic Layer:** Semantic Web, RDF, SPARQL, SHACL
* **The Physical Layer:** Home Assistant (Integrations, Automations, Sensors, Actuators, Infrastructure)
* **Interests:** Causal Inference, Biohacking, Physics of Consciousness, and Psychological Operations (PsyOps).

### Philosophy: The Negentropy Principle
I define **"Magic" as Negentropy** - the capacity to generate order from chaos and preserve information against the gradient of decay.
* **Entropic Excess:** The root of systemic decoherence and suffering.
* **Zero Entropy:** Total stasis and sterility.
* **Goal:** A dynamic homeostasis between Chaos and Order.

True intelligence necessitates grounding in the axioms of logic and consciousness. I aim to build systems that model the causal fabric of reality itself.
