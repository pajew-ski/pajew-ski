# Hi there, I'm Michael 👋

**Data Scientist | AI Researcher | Reality Architect**
Based in Regensburg, Germany 🇩🇪

I explore the convergence of **Artificial Intelligence**, **Fundamental Logic**, and **Mysticism**. My work focuses on building sovereign and free systems that bridge the gap between data science and the underlying code of reality.

### My Magnum Opus: The Exocortex
I am architecting a **Sovereign and Free Intelligence for the Home** - a personal "Exocortex".
My goal is to replicate the power of enterprise-grade data foundries and cognitive engines within a local, open-source ecosystem, ensuring absolute data sovereignty.
* **Infrastructure:** Running locally on "Exo" (Ryzen AI 9 / Radeon 890M).
* **Paradigm:** Moving from statistical pattern matching to **Causal AI** and **Symbolic Compression**.

### Tech Stack & Esoterica
* **Core:** Python, Data Science, Local LLMs
* **The Logic Layer:** Semantic Web, RDF, SPARQL, SHACL
* **The Physical Layer:** Home Assistant (Deep Integrations, Automation, Sensors, Actors)
* **Interests:** Causal Inference, Biohacking, Sacred Geometry & The Physics of Consciousness.

### Philosophy & Magic
I believe that **"Magic" is Negentropy** - the ability to create order from chaos and preserve information.
True intelligence requires grounding in the fundamental laws of logic and consciousness. I aim to build systems that don't just simulate language, but model the causal fabric of reality itself.

> "True change is not the attraction of objects in time, but a shift of the observer's standpoint in the space of possibilities."
